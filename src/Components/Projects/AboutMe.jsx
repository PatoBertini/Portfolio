          My name is Patricio Bertini, I am 28 years old, and I live in
          Valencia, Spain. I have a degree in Economics and I am also a
          professional Chef but I have been interested in Computing and in the
          IT area my entire life. This 2022 I decided to leave the comfort zone
          and decided to launch myself into this new career doing what I am
          passionate about, Programming. <br />
          Today I finished my studies as a
          front-end developer. However, I keep on studying to become a Full
          Stack Developer in the near future. I am seeking a new position as
          Junior Front-end, and to achieve this objective, I have created this portfolio to
          expose the projects I have carried out so far. Hope you enjoy it! <br />
          Please do not hesitate to contact me, thank you very much in advance. <br />
